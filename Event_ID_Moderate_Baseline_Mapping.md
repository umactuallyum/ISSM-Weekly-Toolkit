# Weekly Event ID Review - NISPOM (DCSA) / NIST SP 800-53 Moderate Baseline

Event IDs pulled by `Weekly-EventLog-Review.ps1`, which ones to review each week, and the controls each supports.

NISPOM classified systems are authorized by **DCSA** using the NIST SP 800-53 baselines. NIST does not publish a fixed Event ID list: AU-2 has each organization define its audited events, and AU-6 sets how often they are reviewed. **Confirm both values in your SSP.** The audit settings follow the **DISA Windows 11 STIG**, the usual hardening standard.

## Where to find each event

| Log (column in tables below) | Event Viewer path | Raw copy saved by the script |
|---|---|---|
| Security | Windows Logs > Security | Week folder `Security.evtx` |
| System | Windows Logs > System | Week folder `System.evtx` |
| PowerShell/Operational | Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PowerShell > Operational | Week folder `PowerShell.evtx` |
| Defender/Operational | Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > Windows Defender > Operational | `AV_OS_Updates\Defender.evtx` |
| PrintService/Operational | Applications and Services Logs > Microsoft > Windows > PrintService > Operational | Week folder `PrintService.evtx` |
| Setup | Windows Logs > Setup | `AV_OS_Updates\Setup.evtx` |

In Event Viewer, open the log, click **Filter Current Log** on the right, and type the Event ID. In the script output, **Review** events are in `WeeklyReview.csv` and `Events.csv`; **Filter** and **Archive** events are in `Events.csv`; update events are in the month's `AV_OS_Updates` folder. Each CSV row also has `EventViewerPath` and `FoundIn` columns.

## How the list is organized

| Tier | Meaning | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|
| **Review** (60 IDs) | Look at every week; every occurrence should be explainable | `<HOST>_<date>_WeeklyReview.csv` (start here) |
| **Filter** (2 IDs) | High volume (4688 processes, 4104 PowerShell). Search them for unusual activity or during an investigation | `Events.csv`, filter `WeeklyReview = Filter` |
| **Archive** (26 IDs) | Collected and kept for evidence and investigations; no weekly review needed | `Events.csv` and the weekly `.evtx` files |

**Applies to every Event ID:** AU-2 (event logging), AU-3 (record content), AU-6 (review), AU-12 (record generation).

**Notes**
- **Print records (307) include document names.** On a classified system a document title can itself be classified. Handle and mark the weekly CSVs and `.evtx` files at the classification level of the system.
- 4660, 4663, 4670 (files) are only written for folders that have auditing (SACL) set. Set it on the folders holding classified data.
- Domain-only events (4728, 4729, 4756, 4757, 4739) stay at 0 on standalone systems; that is expected.
- 4616 appears weekly from normal clock sync by LOCAL SERVICE; only changes by a user need review.
